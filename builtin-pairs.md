# Working with Builtin Pairs
This document serves as a guide for working with Plutus Core builtin pairs. It's primarily meant for Pluto and Plutarch developers.

> Note: If you spot any mistakes/have any related questions that this guide lacks the answer to, please don't hesitate to raise an issue. The goal is to have high quality documentation for Pluto and Plutarch users!

For using and operating on builtin pairs, all you need are a few builtin functions. These are discussed below.
## `FstPair`
Here's the synonym to Haskell's `fst`! Its type looks like- `FstPair :: forall a b. BuiltinPair a b -> a`. It takes *two* forces, which you may already have known from [Builtin Function Reference](builtin-functions.md). You force it twice, and pass in a builtin pair, and you get the first element of the pair.

### Pluto Usage
You can call `FstPair` as you would any other function, just make sure you force it!
```hs
! ! FstPair p
```
Where `p` is a builtin pair.

### Plutarch Usage
Plutarch has a synonym to `FstPair`, `pfstBuiltin` (`Plutarch.Builtin`)-
```hs
pfstBuiltin :: Term s (PBuiltinPair a b :--> a)
pfstBuiltin = phoistAcyclic $ pforce $ pforce $ punsafeBuiltin PLC.FstPair
```

You would use it like any other Plutarch level function.
```hs
pfstBuiltin # p
```
Where `p` is of type `PBuiltinPair a b`.

## `SndPair`
We can't just have `FstPair` without `SndPair` now, can we? Its type looks like `SndPair :: forall a b. BuiltinPair a b -> b`. It also takes *two* forces. You force it twice, and pass in a builtin pair, and you get the second member.

### Pluto Usage
You can call `SndPair` as you would any other function, just make sure you force it!
```hs
! ! SndPair p
```
Where `p` is a builtin pair.

### Plutarch Usage
Plutarch has a synonym to `SndPair`, `psndBuiltin` (`Plutarch.Builtin`)-
```hs
psndBuiltin :: Term s (PBuiltinPair a b :--> b)
psndBuiltin = phoistAcyclic $ pforce $ pforce $ punsafeBuiltin PLC.SndPair
```

You would use it like any other Plutarch level function.
```hs
psndBuiltin # p
```
Where `p` is of type `PBuiltinPair a b`.

## `MkPairData`
Now we get to build a pair! A pair of `Data`.

Its type looks like `MkPairData :: Data -> Data -> BuiltinPair Data Data`. It takes two `Data` elements, and returns a pair of those elements.

### Pluto Usage
You can call `MkPairData` as you would any other function.
```hs
MkPairData x y
```
Where `x` and `y` are both `data` values.

### Plutarch Usage
Plutarch has a synonym to `MkPairData`, `ppairDataBuiltin` (`Plutarch.Builtin`)-
```hs
ppairDataBuiltin :: Term s (PAsData a :--> PAsData b :--> PBuiltinPair (PAsData a) (PAsData b))
ppairDataBuiltin = punsafeBuiltin PLC.MkCons
```

You would use it like any other Plutarch level function.
```hs
ppairDataBuiltin # x # y
```
Where `x` and `y` are of type `PAsData a` and `PAsData b` respectively.

## Extra stuff
Wondering how to make pairs of elements other than `Data`. Well, you won't *really* need to do that most of the time. But you can! You just need to build a constant directly.

This is not currently possible in Pluto. But if you're using Plutarch, read [constant building](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/blob/master/docs/GUIDE.md#constants) and [`PLift`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/blob/master/docs/GUIDE.md#plift).

Here's how to make the pair of integer and bytestring in Plutarch-
```hs
pf :: (Integer, ByteString) -> Term s (PBuiltinPair PInteger PByteString)
pf = pconstant
```

Of course, this is a Haskell level function, operating on Haskell data types - to build Plutarch term. So this still won't work if you want to apply it to dynamic Plutarch terms.
